# Dissertation_Ambient_Intelligence_System
An Ambient Intelligence Learning System developed in 2014, as part of a dissertation for MSc Advanced Computer Science at Sussex University.

The system was specifically designed to operate on a Raspberry Pi using the Pi4J API. There were a number of setbacks during the development of this project, which limited it's potential.

As of 2020 onwards, I am re-architecting and building this project on AWS.
